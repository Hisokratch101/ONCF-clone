Railway Ticket Reservation System
Description

Our project aims to develop a train station ticket counter application in Java with a graphical user interface based on Swing. The main objective is to automate ticket counter operations to reduce traveler waiting times and optimize ticket sales management. Key features include managing journeys, discount cards, generating reports for the administrator, and selling tickets and printing them for travelers. The technologies used include Java for the business logic, Swing for the GUI, and MySQL for storing information. The project is structured in three main stages: analyzing requirements with UML diagrams (Use Case), designing the application with class diagrams and GUI mockups, and implementation including the implementation of business logic, GUI, and integration of the database. Unit tests are also conducted for each component of the application.
